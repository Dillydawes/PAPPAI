Why be scared of General AI, why not use it as we use all of the other tools that we create. And if you really put your mind around it there I think we are very close to what we need now.  But before we start we need to set some goals or needs to bring AI to bare for us.  


Now, these are things that I think we need we would want to protect ourselves from the wild west that the web is today. And truly every day it seems to get worse, from both a user perspective and from the view of people that try to take care of it. 


One, the user AI system should first and foremost protect the user.  This should include all public documents and public information about the user. All of the user's public data should be secured. 


Two, all of the user AI systems setting and communication should be clear settings to the user. There should be no communication with the outside world made in the clear. These communications should be all be approved by the user. 


Three, All of the users AI system hardware, software and firmware must be updatable so when issues come up the users and fix the issue and continue to use the system. These updates must be distributed in a secure way.






Now I know that the “goals” above seem like a long shot but I really think that we need to consider what AI is currently good at.  Right now as I right this there is AI that has beaten over five hundred thousand parking/ speeding tickets.  And it is currently moving on to get people out of jail now that their laws have changed on softer Drugs. This type of AI could be applied in the user AI system to go through the user's online accounts and social media accounts and actually understand the TOS and even free the user's data from the services. 


To expand even more the system to implement open search algos to find all relevant data on the user and then plan with the user how to secure this data.  The use of other closed APIs would be discouraged by the dev team because of security reasons.


Currently, we have AI firewalls with tech that is called IDS and IPS.  These systems respond to not only knows signatures for bad files but they detect and respond to user or automated behavior.  And they block or stop traffic that is bad for the network. This could be applied to the user AI to protect the user's network and protect the on-site data set. 


During the setup of the system, the system with make communication with the update point and create their rotating encryption key that will be used during the update process.


I imagine that there is a possibility that the user's data could be stored in the cloud if the files could be encrypted and stored in a format that only the user AI system could decrypt.  I would think that the project could leverage one of the cryptocurrencies block chains to encrypt and store the user's data off-site.  I feel like this could be done using a custom FPGA chip in the system that is dedicated to encrypting the user's data.
